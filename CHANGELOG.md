# Changelog

All notable changes to the open-source CONTEXA core are documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog and the project follows semantic versioning in principle.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **A user can answer a CHALLENGE in `contexa.infrastructure.mode=distributed` whatever the sign-in is made of.** An MFA
  flow stored in Redis could not be read back when the sign-in held a read-only collection (a one-time token or a
  remember-me sign-in with Contexa's user or Spring's `User`, a JWT, an OAuth2 login) or an object the reading node
  cannot load, and the user could not go on. A stored flow now keeps of a sign-in of any kind only what the flow reads:
  the name, the authorities, whether it is authenticated and the facts of the login. The principal, the credentials and
  the application's classes no longer reach Redis, and a stored flow keeps the login's method and time as the in-memory
  flow does. An attribute that cannot be stored or read back (a value of the application's policy) is left out with an
  error in the log, and the rest of the flow stays.
- A stored flow that cannot be read now stops the request and stays as it is. It used to be replaced by the copy the
  request held, without the version check.
- A request running beside a write no longer finds no flow in Redis and ends it.
- Flows in progress in Redis when this version starts cannot be read and start again: the stored form changed.

### Changed

- **Every database object Contexa creates starts with `ctxa_`**: tables, views, sequences, indexes and named
  constraints (`users` is now `ctxa_users`, `contexa_schema_provenance` is `ctxa_schema_provenance`). A table of your
  application with a plain name (`users`, `role`, `audit_log`, ...) is never read, changed or renamed, even in the same
  database. The tables Spring Security and Spring Authorization Server fix in their own SQL (`one_time_tokens`,
  `user_credentials`, `user_entities`, `oauth2_*`) are used under the prefix too, ShedLock's table is `ctxa_shedlock`,
  and the vector store's default table is `ctxa_vector_store` (its index `ctxa_vector_store_index`, the name Spring AI
  looks for).
- **An existing Contexa database is moved automatically**, in one transaction, when the data source is created, before
  any bean reads from it: tables, sequences, indexes, constraints and the recorded ownership of the tables follow, and
  data and sequence positions stay as they were. Only a database that has all of Contexa's marker tables under the old
  names is moved; if only some of them exist, they are taken for the application's own and left as they are, and if
  both names exist for a table the start stops without changing anything. Nodes that start together are safe (one
  moves the database under a database lock, the others wait and find it moved), but a node of the earlier version
  cannot run against a moved database: stop every node of the earlier version before the first node of this version
  starts, and keep a backup as for any upgrade.
- `spring.ai.vectorstore.pgvector.table-name` and `contexa.rag.etl.vector-table-name` default to `ctxa_vector_store`; a
  configuration that names `vector_store` explicitly points at a table Contexa no longer creates.

### Added

- `LibraryTableNames` (contexa-common) wraps the `JdbcOperations` handed to the Spring libraries' JDBC classes so that
  they use the prefixed tables; a test reads the libraries' SQL constants and fails when one of them names a table the
  wrapper does not know.
- HOST_OWNED and CONTEXA_OWNED: Contexa's enforcement is the same in both; they differ only in who owns sign-in, session
  and authorization (see the installation guide). HOST_OWNED enforces after the application's own chain, takes no part
  in its sign-in, session, cookie, locale or message bundle, asks for a mail code or a passkey on its own screens, and
  keeps a separate console chain with its own sign-in policy.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-02

### Fixed

- The IAM seed scripts are read as UTF-8, like the schema. Java 17 takes its default charset from the operating
  system, so the Korean seed data was stored garbled on Korean Windows (MS949) and the startup failed on a unique
  constraint under a POSIX locale.

### Added

- `contexa.iam.seed.admin.password` (with `.username`, default `admin`, and `.email`, default `admin@localhost`)
  creates one administrator in the system administrators group at the start. An existing user with that name or
  e-mail is never changed, so a password changed in the admin console stays. Without the password nothing is created.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- Open-source AI Native Post-Auth Runtime Control Plane baseline for Spring applications
- Runtime behavioral analysis and zero-trust control flow inside the application layer
- Request-time control actions including `ALLOW`, `CHALLENGE`, `BLOCK`, `ESCALATE`, and `PENDING_ANALYSIS`
- Identity, IAM, and AI runtime modules packaged as a coherent open-source core
- Spring Boot starter for simplified adoption
- Public security policy, contributing guide, code of conduct, issue templates, and CI workflow

### Clarified

- CONTEXA open-source core positioning as a downstream runtime control layer
- Relationship between the open-source core and separate enterprise operational surfaces
- Public links for documentation, benchmark entry, and security contact
